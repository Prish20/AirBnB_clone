- [Airbnb Clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

## Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project

### Overview

Welcome to the exciting journey of building your very own AirBnB clone! Before diving into the code, make sure to familiarize yourself with the AirBnB concept page to understand the vision and functionality of the project.

### Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a command interpreter that will manage your AirBnB objects. This marks the initial step towards constructing a full-fledged web application, encompassing HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

### Key Tasks

- Build a Command Interpreter:
Create a robust command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects effectively. This will serve as the foundation for interacting with your application.
